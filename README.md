This project showcases a series of SQL queries used to analyze the **Maven Movies** database, a fictional DVD rental dataset. The goal is to extract business insights related to staff, inventory, customer activity, film diversity, and payment trends ‚Äî useful for operations, fraud monitoring, and customer engagement strategies.
